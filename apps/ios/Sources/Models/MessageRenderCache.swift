/// LRU cache for rendered `AttributedString` instances keyed by
/// `(itemID, revision)`. Backs the streaming-render path (upstream
/// audit A.5): markdown → `AttributedString` conversion is the hot
/// allocator in the chat list, and re-rendering every visible row on
/// each chunk dominated a frame budget in Instruments traces.
///
/// Why bound at 200:
///   - Each entry is one `AttributedString`; on a typical assistant
///     reply that's a few KB of attribute runs. 200 × ~4 KB ≈ <1 MB
///     resident, which is well below the SwiftUI list's own
///     attributed-text overhead on a long thread.
///   - Conversations rarely keep more than ~100 rendered messages on
///     screen at once; the cap gives 2× headroom for streaming
///     intermediate revisions of in-flight turns.
///
/// Eviction policy: classic LRU. Reads (`get`) move the entry to the
/// most-recently-used position; writes (`set`) either overwrite (and
/// move to MRU) or insert at MRU, evicting the least-recently-used
/// entry once the dictionary exceeds the cap. We use a parallel
/// `[Key]` order array rather than `OrderedDictionary` so we don't
/// take a new dependency for ~200 entries.
