/// Stage 2 host for the Ghostty-libghostty terminal view.
///
/// What Stage 2 ships: the flag-on path is no longer a placeholder —
/// PTY bytes from `SessionStore.terminalBuffer[session.id]` are now
/// fed into `GhosttyVT.Terminal.write(_:)`, the resulting grid is
/// rendered through a CoreText-backed `CALayer`, and keyboard input
/// (hardware + soft + the existing `TerminalAccessoryBar`) round-trips
/// back into the harness via `SessionStore.sendInput(...)`. xterm.js
/// is not loaded on this code path — the flag-off branch in
/// `ProjectView.tabContent` keeps `WKTerminalView` reachable as a
/// one-toggle revert per `docs/PLAN-TERMINAL-REWRITE.md` §E.
///
/// What Stage 2 explicitly does NOT ship (deferred to Stage 3+):
/// - Selection / copy / paste (Ghostty exposes `vt/selection.h` but
///   the wrapper does not yet bridge it; tap-and-hold falls back to
///   the system default, which is "nothing").
/// - SGR colors / styles in the renderer — every cell paints with the
///   default foreground; the VT side parses styles correctly, the
///   renderer just doesn't read them yet.
/// - Wide / combining / emoji clusters are rendered per-cell as a
///   single grapheme; double-width cells aren't drawn at 2× width.
/// - Render-state dirty tracking. The current path re-snapshots every
///   frame the buffer grows; fine for chat-shaped TUIs, will need the
///   `vt/render.h` iterator for `cat large.log` smoothness in Stage 3.
///
/// The architectural decision (§E renderer row): a `CAMetalLayer` was
/// the original Stage 2 plan, but `ghostty-vt.xcframework` ships only
/// the parser/state half of libghostty — no Metal renderer surface
/// (per the Stage 1 risk log). Building a Metal pipeline from scratch
/// for "draw a grid of glyphs at default colors" is out of scope for
/// this PR; CoreText into a CALayer is the cheapest path that
/// satisfies the Stage 2 acceptance criterion ("renders agent output
/// end-to-end through Terminal.write(_:), no xterm.js loaded") and
/// keeps the door open for a Metal swap in Stage 3.
