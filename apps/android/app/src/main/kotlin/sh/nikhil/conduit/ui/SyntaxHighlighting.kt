/**
 * Pure-function language detection mirroring
 * `apps/ios/Sources/Views/SyntaxHighlighting.swift`. Bridges Markdown
 * fence info strings (`"swift"` -> `"swift"`) and file-extension hints
 * (`"foo.swift"` -> `"swift"`) to a canonical highlight.js / Prism4j
 * language id.
 *
 * Lives separately from any UI code so [SyntaxHighlightingLanguageTest]
 * can exercise it with zero Compose dependencies -- and so the
 * rendering integration with Prism4j can ship as a follow-up without
 * touching the detector contract.
 *
 * Why this is a separate file instead of inline in [ChatPage]:
 * PLAN-2026-05-19 calls out "Code block view with syntax highlighting
 * (HighlightSwift on iOS, Prism4j on Android -- same libraries upstream
 * uses)" as the v1 conversation parity gap. Shipping the detector
 * first lets the Rust core's classifier reuse the same canonical id
 * set (e.g. `"ts" -> "typescript"`) without anyone having to read the
 * fenced-code branch in the renderer.
 *
 * Prism4j as a Gradle dep adds significant resolve time and risks CI
 * breakage; the actual highlighting integration is deferred. This
 * detector + a Compose-friendly fallback stub ship now so the call
 * sites have a stable contract to wire against when the dep lands.
