# cut-release.sh — tag-provenance guard for swe-kitty releases.
#
# Why this exists:
#   Releases are tag-triggered (.github/workflows/release.yml). The build runs
#   off whatever commit the tag points at. We once tagged v0.0.35 from a STALE
#   local `main` — the tag captured old code, CI happily shipped it, and a whole
#   on-device test cycle was wasted chasing a "fix" that was never in the build.
#   (The About screen now shows the git SHA so a stale ship is at least visible.)
#
#   This script refuses to create a release tag unless the commit being tagged
#   is exactly origin/main's tip, the working tree is clean, and the tag doesn't
#   already exist. It fetches origin first so the comparison is fresh.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/cut-release.sh vX.Y.Z
#
# Env:
#   DRY_RUN=1   Run all checks but do NOT create or push the tag (for testing).
